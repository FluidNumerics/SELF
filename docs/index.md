## About
 The Spectral Element Libraries in Fortran (SELF) are a set of Fortran modules that define data structures and type-bound procedures that can be used to develop Spectral Element discretizations for partial differential equations. SELF-Fluids is a Forran 2003 class and accompanying programs that can be used to solve for the Compressible Navier Stokes using the Spectral Element Method.
 
SELF-Fluids can be accelerated with CUDA Fortran and also supports multi-threading with OpenMP. MPI only, MPI+CUDA, and MPI+OpenMP flavors of SELF-Fluids are possible, though scaling tests are currently being conducted to improve the MPI implementation.
