## About
 The Spectral Element Libraries in Fortran (SELF) are a set of Fortran modules that define data structures and type-bound procedures that can be used to develop Spectral Element discretizations for partial differential equations. The data structures in the SELF provide support for working with
 
 - Lagrange Polynomials* (accompanied with Chebyshev and Legendre Gauss, Gauss-Radau, and Gauss-Lobatto Quadrature)
 - Unstructured Spectral Element Meshes ( 2-D and 3-D )
 - Discontinuous and Continuous Galerkin discretizations*
 - Spectral Filters
 
 *The routines and structures for the Lagrange Polynomials and the DG and CG discretizations are based on the algorithms provided in David Kopriva's textbook "Implementing Spectral Element Methods for Partial Differential Equations" (2009).
 
 Together, these basic structures enable the development of complex solvers of partial differential equations. Current efforts are focused on working with researchers to develop such high-end solvers for their applications, including solvers for the Shallow Water equations, Compressible Navier Stokes, and the linear Planetary Geostrophic Equations.
