# (Tutorial) Linear Shallow Water - Gravity Wave Release demo with Docker

In this tutorial, you will learn

* Some basic gravity wave theory
* How to build the SELF Docker image
* How to run the Linear Shallow Water model using Docker
* How to visualize the model output using pyself
* How to modify settings for the Linear Shallow Water simulations


## Simulation Description

## 0. Pre-requisites
This tutorial assumes that you are working on a Linux or MacOS workstation and that you are comfortable working in a terminal.

Additionally, you will need to have the following on your system:

* [Docker]() needs to be installed on your system and configured so that you can build and run Docker images
* [git]() needs to be installed on your system so that you can clone the SELF repository onto your local system
* (Optional) [AMD GPU](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/release/gpu_os_support.html) or Nvidia GPU, if you want to run the model with GPU acceleration.


## 1. Build the SELF Docker Image

## 2. Starting from an example input deck

## 3. Select your time integration scheme

## 4. Setting initial conditions and fluid properties

## 5. Run the gravity wave example

## 6. Visualize the model output
