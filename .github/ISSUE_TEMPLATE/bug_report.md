## Describe the bug
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

## Build Process & Environment

Modify this section by retaining only the subsection that is relevant for your build process & environment.

### Pulling a pre-built container
If you are pulling a Docker container from Fluid Numerics' container registry
* Docker container name and tag ( e.g. `gcr.io/self-fluids/self:ce7f8e2-double-sm_72` )

### Build with Dockerfile
If you are building SELF on your own, using the provided Dockerfile :
* Operating System and Version or Build Service (e.g. Google Cloud Build). If your are building locally, you can upload a txt file that has the contents of os-release : `cat /etc/os-release > os.txt` )
* Docker version
* SELF Branch and git sha or tag
* How did you build SELF ? (**Modify the command below and remove this bullet point**)
```
docker build . -t self:local --build-arg GPU_TARGET=gfx906 --build-arg HIP_PLATFORM=amd --build-arg PREC=double
```

### Bare-metal Build
If you are building SELF on your own, directly onto your system (without the provided Dockerfile)
* Operating System name and version ( You can upload a txt file that has the contents of os-release : `cat /etc/os-release > os.txt` )
* User environment ( Upload a txt file generated by running `env > env.txt` )
* SELF Branch and git sha
* Fortran Compiler and Version
* MPI Implementation (OpenMPI, MPICH, MVAPICH ?) and Version.
* ROCm Version 
* HIPFort Version
* JSON-Fortran Version
* FLAP Version
* FEQParse Version
* CUDA Version (if building for Nvidia GPU)
* HDF5 Version 
* How did you build SELF ? (**Modify the command below and remove this bullet point**)
```
export SELF_PREFIX=/opt/self
export PREC=double
export GPU_PLATFORM=gfx906
export HIP_PLATFORM=amd

make
```

## Program & modules using SELF
Describe your program and modules that you are working on that leverage SELF. Share URL to publicly accessible source code and any documentation.

## Deployment Environment & Process

### Target Platform
* Operating System name and version ( You can upload a txt file that has the contents of os-release : `cat /etc/os-release > os.txt` )
* CPU Make/Model (e.g. AMD Epyc Milan)
* GPU Make/Model (e.g. AMD MI250)
* Core Count per Node
* GPU Count per Node
* Number of Nodes
* MPI Implementation and Version (e.g. OpenMPI v4.0.2)
* ROCm Version ( if AMD GPU's are used for deployment )
* CUDA Version (version in your deployment environment )
* Docker version (version in your deployment environment)
* Singularity version (if deployed via Singularity)
* Commands used to run your program
